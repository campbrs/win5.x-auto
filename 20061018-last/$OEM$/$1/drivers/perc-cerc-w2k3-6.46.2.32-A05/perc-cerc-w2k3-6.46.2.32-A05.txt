    Windows 2000 or 2003 System.

3.5.2 Removing the PERC 3/DC, 3/DCL or PERC 3/SC Controller and
      Installing the PERC 4e/DC, 4/DC or PERC 4/SC Controller on a
      Windows 2000 or 2003 System
-------------------------------------------------------------------

The following procedure applies to Windows 2000 and Windows 2003 operating 
systems. To remove the PERC 3/DC, 3/DCL, or 3/SC controller, perform the
following steps:

CAUTION: See the safety instructions in your System Information booklet before 
working inside your
system.

1. Shut down and remove power to the system and any attached external peripherals.
2. Remove the system cabinet cover.
   See the system Installation and Troubleshooting Guide for detailed instructions.

3. Label the SCSI connectors that connect to the 3/DC, 3/DCL and 3/SC controller
   connectors.

CAUTION: If the SCSI connectors are not properly identified with their channel
identification, the PERC 4 controller firmware may be unable to convert to the
correct logical drive configuration (performed in the next procedure.)

4. Disconnect the connectors attached to the PERC 3/DC, 3/DCL and 3/SC controller
   and remove them from the system.

   See the systems Installation and Troubleshooting Guide for instructions.

5. Install the PERC 4e/DC, 4/DC, or 4/SC controller and install the SCSI cables 
   you removed in step 4.
6. Refer to Hardware Installation for detailed instructions on installing and 
   cabling the RAID controller in the system.
7. Close or replace the system cabinet cover.
8. Reconnect the system and peripherals to their power sources.
9. Power on the system.
   The configuration data on the hard drive is used automatically if there is a 
   configuration mismatch (assuming the new controller has no configuration).

NOTE: If you have configured a RAID 5 system with more than four physical drives, 
the disk activity LED blinks after the BIOS configuration is complete. This is
an indication of normal background initialization being performed by the PERC 4
controllers. Background initialization could take hours to complete,
depending on the size of the logical drives. The server is usable, although I/O 
response may be slow. Performance should be back to normal after initialization
is complete.


3.5.3 Changing the Write Policy
-------------------------------

If the new PERC 4e/DC, 4/DC or PERC 4/SC controllers have different battery 
backup settings than the previous controllers, you must change the write policy
of the logical drive to obtain additional performance improvements or avoid data
corruption in the event of power loss.

For example, PERC 3/SC and PERC 3/DCL controllers do not include a battery 
backup unit, while the PERC 4/DC and PERC 3/DC do have a battery backup unit.

If you are upgrading from a PERC 3/SC to a PERC 4/DC, you should change the 
write policy from Write-Through to Write-Back for additional performance
improvements.

If you are upgrading a PERC 3/DC to a PERC 4/DC with the same battery backup 
settings, you do not need to change the write policy.

To change the write policy settings, perform the following steps:
1. From the PERC BIOS Configure Utility, select the Object > Logical Drive menu.
2. Select the logical drive and press <Enter>.
3. Select View/Update Parameters and press <Enter>.
4. Select Write Policy and press <Enter>.
5. Select WrBack or WrThru according to the battery unit setting.
6. If the new adapter does not include the battery backup unit, select WrThru. 
   Otherwise, select WrBack.
7. Press <Esc> as many times as necessary to return to the Logical Drive Menu.
8. Repeat step 2 through step 6 for each logical drive.
9. Reboot your system for the changes to take place.


4.0 Fixes or Enhancements in this Release 
=========================================

W2K 5.48

1. During Bus Reset, the driver issues a call to the F/W and returns without 
   waiting for the call to finish and asks for the next request from OS. This 
   next request got issued to the F/W even before the reset call completed 
   resulting in the reservation conflict. Now the driver does not issue the next
   command until the reset call to the F/W completes. 

W2K3 6.46.2.32

1. If the Adapter is set to DEAD, all the IOCTLs sent to the driver will be 
   returned with a special signature 0xEE to identify that the adapter is DEAD
   and not responding.

2. During Bus Reset, the driver issues a call to the F/W and returns without 
   waiting for the call to finish and asks for the next request from OS. This 
   next request got issued to the F/W even before the reset call completed 
   resulting in the reservation conflict. Now the driver does not issue the next
   command until the reset call to the F/W completes. 

3. SCSI commands issued to the Dummy Device exposed by the driver was not 
   handled properly. Driver should have rejected all the commands issued to the
   Dummy Device except for the SCSIOP_INQUIRY and SCSIIO_READ_CAPACITY. This was
   causing the system to blue screen when using utilities sending SCSI commands
   to the Dummy Device. This release driver handles all the SCSI commands issued
   to the driver gracefully.


5.0 Additional Information
==========================

1. When installing a PERC 3/DCL controller in a system, Windows will 
   automatically load a different PERC driver. This driver will show the PERC
   3/DCL as a PERC 3/DC. You must upgrade the driver to the latest shipping level
   and after this upgrade the PERC 3/DCL will be displayed correctly. 

2. When installing Windows Server 2000 or 2003 in a system and have a PERC 3/QC,
   PERC 3/DC, PERC 3/DCL, PERC 3/SC, PERC 4/DC, PERC 4/SC, PERC 4e/DC, or
   PERC 4e/Di together in a system you will see the following selection when
   choosing a logical drive to configure.

		(xxxxx)mb Disk 0 at Id <y> on bus <z> on mraid35x [MBR]
		
		Where (xxxxx) is the size of the logical  drive.
		Where (y) is the logical drive id per controller.
 		Where (z) is the bus number.
			
If there is more than 1 logical drive per controller then Id number will be 
incremented. 

If there is more than 1 type of controller in a system then multiple selections 
will be displayed per controller.

 		(xxxxx)mb Disk 0 at Id (y) on bus (z) on mraid35x [MBR]

		(xxxxx)mb Disk 0 at Id (y) on bus (z) on mraid35x [MBR]

The user must be careful to select the appropriate id when installing Windows 
Server 2000 or 2003. 


6.0 Revision History
====================

W2K Changes from 5.42 to 5.46

1. A timer routine has been added to the driver's reset path which will 
   periodically be invoked and will calculate the actual system time elapsed
   from the start of the issuing of reset. If more than 3 minutes elapse, the 
   adapter will be marked as failed.
   In a cluster environment during heavy I/O, this would prevent the driver
   from stalling the CPU and allow the cluster to failover instead of freezing.
2. The driver will now expose a failed logical drive to the OS and will complete
   the failed I/O request with the proper status information to prevent a logical
   drive mismatch between the OS and the RAID management utilities.
3. Support added for PERC 4e/Si,PERC 4e/Di,and PERC 4e/DC.


W2K Changes from 5.39 to 5.42

1. File Version has been modified to reflect the product version from this 
   release onwards.
2. Minor change to the setup files.
3. Driver no longer filters out all other commands except SCSI READ and SCSI 
   WRITE
4. The driver will accept only one Reservation call at a time and would allow it 
   to complete before issuing any more commands to the Firmware.
5. The driver will be using an individual commandID for each WriteConfig issued 
   to the Firmware


W2K Changes from 5.35.2 to 5.39 

1. Utilities are issuing driver calls for getting the logical drive statistics. 
   We have seen some utilities are requesting 40LD statistics but send buffer less 
   than the required statistics size. This is causing the system to crash. This
   bug has been fixed in the driver by returning all the calls with lesser buffer size 
   without copying any data successfully.
2. Change in the setup files, so that Scsiport driver should give correct Device 
   Number and Function Number to the Miniport driver.
3. A timeout is implemented in the driver so that driver shouldn't wait 
   infinitely for the Firmware to acknowledge the interrupt.
4. During Reset, Driver was not clearing all the Pending Commands whenever the 
   Firmware is not able to complete it.
5. System was hanging after it wakes up from Hibernation/Standby on PERC 3/QC 
   and PERC 3/DC controllers. Driver needs to reprogram these SCSI chips before 
   waiting for the firmware to initialize.   
6. During the Cluster HCT phase 5 test the driver and firmware used to wait for 
   each other for a command completion. This led to dead lock condition and the HCT 
   test fails with an IO timeout error. In order to avoid this dead lock condition 
   the driver will poll the firmware for completion of a command before the OS 
   times out the command.
7. When running heavy I/O's the miniport driver would often get a mailbox busy 
   condition that would lead to an I/O hang. The fix is made in the driver to 
   improve delay optimization for the mailbox busy condition. 
8. The logical drive status checking was failing for Dummy Device inquiry. This 
   logic was removed since there is no need to check status of this device. 
9. The capability pointer was changed in firmware for Fast READ/WRITE calls for 
   hard drives connected to the SCSI Channels.
10. Initial release of PERC 4/Di support on PE2755MC 
11. Initial release of PERC 4/SC. 

    
W2K Changes from 5.32 to 5.35.2

1. System was not waking up after a hibernation/standby operation. This bug was 
   caused by the driver. Driver was trying to access PCI_CONFIG space from the 
   ScsiRestartAdapter in the driver. This bug has been fixed by accessing the 
   PCI_CONFIG space from the ScsiSetRunningConfig entry point.
2. New command has been introduced to enhance the performance for SCSI I/O on 
   non-raid SCSI channel.
3. In case of cluster reset, Driver was waiting infinitely for all the commands 
   to complete, resulting in the system crash/hang. This problem has been fixed by 
   waiting for certain period of time for the outstanding commands to complete. If 
   the commands are not completed in certain period of time, Driver completes all 
   the outstanding with error and returns.
4. In case of Standby, driver was not waiting for the Firmware to get 
   initialized, resulting in the driver sending commands to the firmware even when 
   the Firmware is not initialized. The fix has been put in the driver. Driver is 
   polling for the Firmware to get initialized before sending any commands to the 
   Firmware.
5. A single Tape drive was seen at TargetID 0 and TargetID 16 on the physical 
   channel.  One can attach up to a maximum of 15 devices on a single physical 
   channel. All the requests coming for a physical channel with TargetID greater 
   than 15 should be returned as Illegal request.


W2K Version 5.32.0.0

1. Initial release of PERC 4/Di on PE2600.


W2K3 Changes from 6.35.2.32 to 6.41.2.32

1. A timer routine has been added to the driver's reset path which will 
   periodically be invoked and will calculate the actual system time elapsed 
   from the start of the issuing of reset. If more than 3 minutes elapse, the 
   adapter will be marked as failed.
   In a cluster environment during heavy I/O, this would prevent the driver from 
   stalling the CPU and allow the cluster to failover instead of freezing.
2. The driver will now expose a failed logical drive to the OS and will complete
   the failed I/O request with the proper status information to prevent a logical 
   drive mismatch between the OS and the RAID management utilities.
3. Support added for PERC 4e/Si,PERC 4e/Di,and PERC 4e/DC.
4. The driver addresses a potential system freeze during reset. 
5. The driver now returns the Bus interrupt level in the PCI information structure
   for use in the RAID utilities.
6. The TimeOut Value in the Registry entry under Disk.sys has been increased to 
   60 secs from 40 secs to prevent Event ID 9.
7. Support for MegaRAID SCSI 320-0X support added to the registry.
8. Support has been added for the SATA(523) SAF-TE device from AMI.
9. Support has been added for the Intel(R) Storage RAID Controller SRCU42 to the 
   driver and the setup files.  


W2K3 Changes from 6.32.2.32 to 6.35.2.32

1. Minor change to Oemsetup.txt file.
2. Driver no longer filters out all other commands except SCSI READ and SCSI 
   WRITE.


W2K3 Changes from 6.25 to 6.32.2.32

1. Changes in the setup files, so that Scsiport driver should give the correct
   device number and function number to the miniport driver.
2. A timeout is implemented in the driver so that driver shouldn't wait 
   infinitely for the firmware to acknowledge the interrupt.
3. The driver will return an error status for all the offline logical drives.
4. Utilities are issuing 0xc3 calls for getting the logical drive statistics. 
   This is causing the system to crash. This bug has been fixed in the driver.
5. The driver is using Hal functions to program hierarchy bridges and SCSI 
   chips when system goes to D3 standby state.  

   The use of Hal functions were not allowing the driver to pass the HCT test.
   So we have to disable the Hal calls in the previous releases. A workaround
   has been done in the driver whereby all the Hal calls have been replaced by
   its assembly equivalent.
6. During reset, the driver was not clearing all the pending commands whenever 
   the firmware is not able to complete it.
7. Driver is allocating enough continuous memory for the
   FLASH_WRITE_BLOCK(0x2c) command.
8. The system gives a blue screen when one swaps the boot controller. This bug
   has been fixed by adding entries of all the supported controllers in the
   critical data base section of the registry through changes in the
   oemsetup.inf file.
9. The system was not waking up after a hibernation/standby operation. This bug 
   was caused by the driver. The driver was trying to access PCI_CONFIG space from 
   the ScsiRestartAdapter in the driver. This bug has been fixed by accessing the 
   PCI_CONFIG space from the ScsiSetRunningConfig entry point.
10. A new command has been introduced to enhance the performance for SCSI I/O on 
    non-raid SCSI channel.
11. In case of standby, the driver was not waiting for the firmware to get 
    initialized. This resulted in the driver sending commands to the firmware
    even when the firmware is not initialized. The fix has been put in the
    driver. The driver is polling for the Firmware to get initialized before
    sending any commands to the firmware.
12. The PERC 3 Firmware was not able to handle multiple reserve commands for a 
    logical drive. This was leading to reservation failures on some of the
    logical drives. A fix has been done in the driver where the driver would
    accept only one reservation call at a time and would allow it to complete
    before issuing any more commands to the firmware.
